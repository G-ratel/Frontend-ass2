		<h2>Red velvet cake</h2>
		<p>This is my second favorite recipe.</p>
		<img src="Red-Velvet.jpg" alt="Red-Velvet Cake" style="width:30%;"/>
		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>all-purpose flour</li>
			<li>cornstarch</li>
			<li>unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
			<li>baking doda</li>
			<li>salt</li>
			<li>granulated sugar</li>
			<li>unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
			<li>large eggs</li>
			<li>vanilla extract</li>
			<li>vegetable or canola oil</li>
			<li>red food colouring</li>
			<li>buttermilk</li>
			<li>distilled wine vinegar</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Directions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat oven to 350°F/180°C. Grease two 8-inch or 9-inch cake pans that are at least 2-inches high, and line the bottom of the pan with a round piece of parchment paper.</li>
			<li>In a medium bowl, sift together flour, cornstarch, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
			<li>In a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together butter and sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy, 3-4 minutes. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as necessary. Beat in oil. The batter might look a bit curdled, that's ok. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well between each addition. Add vanilla and vinegar and beat until combined. Add red food coloring, until desired color is reached. With the mixer on low speed, add half of the dry ingredients and beat just until combined. Add buttermilk, followed by the rest of the dry ingredients. Do not over mix.</li>
			<li>Divide batter evenly between pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow cakes to cool in the pan on a wire rack until they're easy to handle, then remove from pan and allow to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>

		<h2>Chocolate cream pie</h2>
		<p>This is my third favorite recipe.</p>
		<img src="CCP.jpg" alt="Chocolate cream Pie" style="width:30%;"/>
		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>digestive biscuits</li>
			<li>butter</li>
			<li>milk</li>
			<li>sugar</li>
			<li>corn flour</li>
			<li>plain flour</li>
			<li>eggs</li>
			<li>double cream</li>
			<li>dark chocolate</li>
			<li>icing sugar for dusting</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Directions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Place the digestive biscuits in a large bowl, and using the end of a rolling pin crush them until they resemble fine crumbs.</li>
			<li>Melt the butter gently in a small pan. When melted add the crushed biscuit and stir well.</li>
			<li>Press the biscuit and butter mix into the base and sides of a 8.5inch fluted flan tin. Chill in the fridge for 1.5hours before filling.</li>
			<li>For the filling, heat the milk gently in a saucepan.</li>
			<li>Meanwhile mix the sugar, flour, cornflour and eggs in a bowl. Stir in the heated milk, mix then return it all to the pan.</li>
			<li>Cook over a low heat until it thickens and just comes to boil. Stir continuously.</li>
			<li>Remove from the heat and stir in the butter and chocolate. Stir until the chocolate has melted and the sauce is smooth.</li>
			<li>Leave to cool slightly then pour the chocolate custard into the biscuit base. Level it off then dust with icing sugar, this prevents a skin forming as it cools.</li>
			<li>Put it back in the fridge to chill, about half an hour.</li>
			<li>When the pie is cold whip the cream and milk together until it is stiff enough to hold its shape. Spoon over the filling and grate some chocolate on the top.</li>

		<h2>Chicken Pie</h2>
		<p>This is my fourth favorite recipe.</p>
		<img src="Chicken-Pie.jpg" alt="Chicken Pie" style="width:30%;"/>
		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul>

			<li>potatoes</li>
			<li>milk</li>

			<li>cheese grated</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Directions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Peel the potatoes and chop into chunks.</li>
			<li>Boil for 10-12 minutes until soft. Drain and leave in the pan without the lid on. This will allow any excess water to evaporate.</li>

			<li>Gently heat the pan, when the margarine has melted stir the sauce, keep stirring until it thickens.</li>
